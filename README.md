# Resistor-Band-Picture-Creator

## Created by Dominic Gaiero for CP IEEE website

## Usage:

To run the program, use:

```
python resistorDialog.py
```
For more information, see `exampleVal.csv`

If you want to use the executable, there is one in the `build > exe.win-amd64-3.5` directory. It is named `CPIEEE_RESISTOR.exe`. The script was frozen with cx_freeze.

To use, select a CSV file formatted as follows:
```
Resistor Value (normal),tolerence (in %),Number of bands
```.

Then, select any diretory to output the pictures.
