# Resistor-Band-Picture-Creator

## Created by Dominic Gaiero for CP IEEE website

## Usage:

To run the program, use:

```
python resistorDialog.py
```
The CSV file is expected to be:
```
Resistor Value (normal),tolerence (in %),Number of bands,band0,band1,band2,band3,band4
```
For more information, see `exampleVal.csv`

If you want to use the executable, there is a shortcut in the main directory. The script was frozen with cx_freeze.
